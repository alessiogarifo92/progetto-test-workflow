# Focus Timer

Static Pomodoro web app (vanilla JS, no build step, no backend). Test project for the `alessiogarifo92/claude-skills` workflow.

## Bootstrap: load the shared skills repo (do this before any work)

This project relies on the private repo `alessiogarifo92/claude-skills` (skills, agents, global rules). A remote session (Claude Code on the web, a cloud container, a GitHub Action) does not have `~/.claude/`, so without this step none of those rules apply.

1. Attach it: `mcp__claude-code-remote__add_repo` with `owner=alessiogarifo92`, `repo=claude-skills` (access `read`), run the clone command it returns, then `register_repo_root`.
2. Run `bash <clone>/scripts/install.sh` (links every skill into `~/.claude/skills`, agents into `~/.claude/agents`, `CLAUDE.md` into `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`), then check `ls ~/.claude/skills ~/.claude/agents`. If the running session does not pick the agents up, dispatch `general-purpose` with an explicit `model` and the agent file's body pasted into the brief, plus an instruction to load that agent's frontmatter `skills:` with the Skill tool first and to respect its read-only / no-git limits. If a named skill is still missing from the Skill list, Read `<clone>/<skill>/SKILL.md` directly and follow it. Read the clone's `README.md`.
3. New application or project: invoke `project-lifecycle` first, then `autonomous-workflow` to run its phases unattended. An existing backlog or multi-stage goal: `autonomous-workflow`. A single ticket: `product-ownership`.
   Claude Code detects agent files added to an existing `~/.claude/agents/` without a restart, but not when that directory did not exist at session start (typical in a fresh container). Then either restart the session once, or use the fallback above for this session. `templates/session-start-hook.sh` can install everything before the session starts (best effort).
4. If the attach fails, say so in visible text and ask the user how to proceed. Never continue silently without the rules.

Run / preview (manual gate): `none` yet — set at stage 4.5. Until then the gate is parked with local commands.

Needed environment variables / connectors for this project: none.

Decisions live in `docs/decisions.md`; read it before re-deriving anything.
